This plugin helps to find recursively all usages of given function. It creates a tree of usages whose nodes are methods, endpoints or tests.

By changing a function now you can see what other functions, endpoints or tests it will affect. It's useful especially for refactoring or reverse engineering.

Supports detections for: Symfony routes, PHPUnit tests
