This plugin helps to find recursively all usages of given function. It creates a tree of usages whose nodes are methods, endpoints or tests.
<br>
By changing a function now you can see what other functions, endpoints or tests it will affect. It's useful especially for refactoring or reverse engineering.
<br>
If a function calls the function that is already exist in the tree, the cyclic icon is shown.

Supports detections for: Symfony routes (as annotations), Laravel routes, PHPUnit tests
